**Slide 1: Title**

# Pet Armor Builder 🛡️
### Visual Upselling for Pet Insurance Coverage

A delightful tool that shows pets getting "armored up" as customers select higher coverage tiers

*Built for Spot Pet Insurance Pet Project Day*

**Slide 2: The Problem**

# Insurance Is Abstract

**Challenge:** Coverage tiers are just numbers
- $5k vs. Unlimited annual limits
- 70% vs. 90% reimbursement
- Customers struggle to visualize value differences

**Opportunity:** Make protection tangible and engaging
- Emotional connection to pet safety
- Gamification without being pushy
- Differentiate from competitors

---

**Slide 3: How It Works**

# Protection Score System (0-100 points)

**4 Parameters Drive Armor Level:**
- Annual Limit (30 pts): $5k → $10k → Unlimited
- Reimbursement % (30 pts): 70% → 80% → 90%
- Deductible (25 pts): $1,000 → $500 → $250 (inverse scoring)
- Wellness Tier (15 pts): None → Gold → Platinum

**Visual Result:**
- 0-25 pts = Light armor (vest)
- 26-50 pts = Medium armor (vest + collar)
- 51-75 pts = Heavy armor (full protection)
- 76-100 pts = Ultimate knight mode + celebration effects!
