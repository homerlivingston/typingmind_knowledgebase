# AI Asset Generation Prompts for Pet Armor Builder

Use these prompts with DALL-E, Midjourney, or other AI image generators.

**IMPORTANT SETTINGS:**
- Request transparent background (PNG format)
- Specify "front view" or "directly facing camera"
- Use "flat design" or "2D game asset style" for consistency
- Request "no shadows" for easier layering

---

## 🐾 BASE PET IMAGES (Generate First)

### Dog - Base Character
```
A cute golden retriever sitting upright, facing directly forward, centered in frame,
friendly happy expression, simple cartoon style, flat 2D design, no background,
transparent PNG, mobile game character art style, clean vector look, no shadows,
symmetrical composition, suitable for overlaying armor
```

**Alternative style options:**
- "pixar animation style" for more polished look
- "flat geometric design" for minimalist
- "chibi style" for cute exaggerated proportions

### Cat - Base Character
```
A cute orange tabby cat sitting upright, facing directly forward, centered in frame,
friendly expression, simple cartoon style, flat 2D design, no background,
transparent PNG, mobile game character art style, clean vector look, no shadows,
symmetrical composition, suitable for overlaying armor
```

**Tips:**
- Keep both pets roughly same size/composition for consistency
- Avoid complex backgrounds or accessories
- Pets should be sitting/standing in neutral pose

## 📐 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Sizing Guidelines
When generating, request these approximate dimensions:

- **Base Pets**: 512x512px (square, centered)
- **Body Armor**: 400x500px (slightly vertical)
- **Shields**: 600x600px (large square, center transparent)
- **Helmets**: 300x300px (square)
- **Glow Effects**: 700x700px (large square, very transparent)
- **Badges**: 128x128px (small icon)

### Layering Order (Z-Index)
For proper visual stacking:
1. Glow effects (background)
2. Shield (behind pet)
3. Body armor (on pet body)
4. Pet (center)
5. Helmet (on pet head)
6. Badges (foreground)

## 🎨 STYLE CONSISTENCY TIPS

**Add these to ALL prompts for consistency:**
- "same art style as previous image"

- "mobile game asset aesthetic"

**Color Palette:**
- Body Armor: Blue scale (#3B82F6 to #1E3A8A)
- Shield: Cyan scale (#22D3EE to #06B6D4)
- Helmet: Purple scale (#A855F7 to #6B21A8)
- Gold accents: #FCD34D
- Wellness glow: Green (#34D399) or Gold (#FDE047)

## 🔄 GENERATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Generate Pets (2 images)
1. Dog base
2. Cat base

**Test fit**: Make sure they're centered and similar size

### Step 2: Generate Armor Sets (9 images)
1. Body armor - basic
2. Body armor - standard
3. Body armor - premium
4. Shield - basic
5. Shield - standard
6. Shield - premium
7. Helmet - basic
8. Helmet - standard
9. Helmet - premium

**Test layering**: Place armor over pets to check positioning

### Step 3: Generate Effects (3 images)
1. Wellness glow - gold
2. Wellness glow - platinum
3. Star badge

**Test transparency**: Ensure glows are translucent enough

## 🛠️ POST-GENERATION CLEANUP

After generating with AI, you may need to:

1. **Remove backgrounds** (if AI included one)
   - Use remove.bg
   - Use Photoshop "Remove Background"
   - Use GIMP with select-by-color

2. **Adjust transparency** (for shields/glows)
   - Open in image editor
   - Adjust layer opacity
   - Save as PNG with alpha channel

3. **Resize consistently**
   - Use same scale for all armor levels
   - Keep pets at same size

4. **Center assets**
   - Use canvas resize to center
   - Ensure symmetric positioning

## 🚀 ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLER GEOMETRIC STYLE

If photorealistic/cartoon isn't working, try geometric:

```
A simple geometric dog made of circles and rounded rectangles, sitting pose,
front view, flat design, primary colors, minimalist app icon style, no details,
transparent background PNG, 2D vector style, no shadows, perfectly symmetrical
```

This style is:
- Easier for AI to generate consistently
- Cleaner for UI overlay
- More "design-y" and professional

## 💡 PLATFORM-SPECIFIC TIPS

### DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT Plus)
- Works great with detailed prompts
- Good at transparent backgrounds
- May need to specify "PNG" explicitly
- Can do 1024x1024 or 1792x1024

### Midjourney
- Add `--no background` to prompts
- Use `--ar 1:1` for square images
- May need post-processing for transparency
- Great for stylistic consistency with `--sref`

### Stable Diffusion (local/free)
- Use "transparent background" in prompt
- May need ControlNet for precise positioning
- Can use same seed for consistency
- Better control over output
