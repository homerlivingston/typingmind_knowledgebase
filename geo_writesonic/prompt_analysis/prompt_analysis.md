## Where We Can Improve

### Priority 1: Close the 0% Visibility Gap (384 Prompts)

**Challenge:** 85% of prompts show no Spot visibility while competitors dominate these queries.

**Opportunity Categories:**
- **Informational queries** - "how does pet insurance work", "what does pet insurance cover"
- **Comparison queries** - "compare pet insurance companies", "best pet insurance for X"
- **Decision-stage queries** - "which pet insurance should I choose", "is pet insurance worth it"

**Strategic Impact:** Capturing even 10% of these prompts (38 prompts) would nearly **double our current visibility footprint**.

### Priority 2: Scale 16% Visibility Prompts to 33%+ (61 Prompts)

**Current State:** 61 prompts showing 16% visibility are **already performing** but need optimization to reach top-tier (33%+).

**Key Topic Areas:**
- **Multi-Pet Insurance** - 3 prompts at 16% (aligns with Priority #1 business initiative)
- **Fast Claims Processing** - 6 prompts at 16% (competitive advantage opportunity)
- **No Network Restrictions** - Multiple prompts at 16% (core USP differentiation)
- **Wellness & Preventive Care** - Strong growth momentum

**Strategic Impact:** Doubling visibility on these 61 prompts (16% → 33%) would create significant competitive separation.

### Priority 3: Protect & Amplify 33% Visibility Winners (6 Prompts)

**Current State:** Only 6 prompts showing 33% visibility - these are our proof points for what works.

**Replication Strategy:**
1. Analyze what makes these prompts successful (content, citations, positioning)
