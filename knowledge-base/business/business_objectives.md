# Business Objectives - Spot Pet Insurance

## Mission & Strategic Vision

**Our Mission:** To help pets and their parents lead longer, healthier, and happier lives.

**Strategic Focus:** Spot operates with laser focus on achieving $350M Gross Written Premium before February 2026. All strategic decisions and resource allocation center on this singular, short-term objective, with future goals remaining secondary until this milestone is achieved.

**Core Philosophy:** Every decision at Spot is data-driven. We continuously run A/B tests across our entire user journey to optimize the three fundamental components of GWP growth: conversion, retention, and Average Order Value (AOV).

## Primary Business Objectives

### The GWP Growth Formula: Conversion × Retention × AOV

Our business strategy centers on three interconnected priorities that directly drive Gross Written Premium growth:

#### 1. Conversion Optimization - Getting More Users to Quote
**Objective:** Maximize the flow of qualified prospects into our quote funnel
**Approach:** Data-driven testing of every customer touchpoint
**Recent Success Example:** Adding Spot Perks discounts to quote form step 2 resulted in 14% increase in quoter-to-policy conversion
**Focus Areas:**
- Continuous A/B testing of CTAs, images, copy, and user journey logic
- Eliminating friction points in awareness-to-quote journey
- Optimizing channel performance based on comprehensive analytics

#### 2. Retention Excellence - Reducing Cancellations
**Objective:** Hold onto the customer book we've built while continuing growth
**Strategic Shift:** Recently evolved from pure growth focus to balanced growth-plus-retention approach
**Key Driver:** Claims experience optimization as the primary retention lever
**Focus Areas:**
- Solving vet medical records retrieval challenges that cause wrongful claim denials
- Increasing successful claims filing as the strongest retention predictor
- Optimizing proxy behaviors: member center registration, direct deposit setup, app downloads

#### 3. Average Order Value Growth - Upselling Strategy
**Objective:** Increase revenue per customer through plan optimization
**Primary Strategy:** Plan configuration upselling with emphasis on comprehensive coverage
**Secondary Strategy:** Annual billing adoption to improve both AOV and retention
**Approach:** Testing-driven upsell optimization without discrimination across product offerings

## Competitive Positioning & Market Strategy

### Premium Brand Positioning
**Market Position:** Spot positions itself as a slightly more premium pet insurance brand, differentiated primarily through brand perception rather than product features
**Key Differentiators:**
- Speedy claims processing and excellent customer service
- Data-driven optimization creating superior customer experience
- Industry-leading retention through claims excellence

### Competitive Advantage: Data-Driven Optimization
**Unique Capability:** Every CTA, image, copy change, and logic modification undergoes extensive A/B testing to understand impact on north star metrics and KPIs
**Examples of Data-Driven Success:**
- Spot Perks display optimization: 14% increase in quoter-to-policy conversion
- Customer engagement timing: Night texting correlates with ~10% increase in clicks, 15% increase in conversions
- Continuous optimization across entire user journey based on conversion, retention, and AOV impact

**Technology Infrastructure:** Comprehensive data ecosystem powered by Databricks, BigQuery, Datadog, and Resonate informing all company decisions

### Claims Experience Excellence Strategy
**Target Claims Flow:**
1. Customer submits claim with optional vet records inclusion
2. Internal processing completed within 2-3 days
3. Payment delivered via direct deposit (when opted in)

**Current Challenge:** Vet medical records retrieval issues causing wrongful claim denials, damaging both brand reputation and retention rates
**Strategic Priority:** Solving records retrieval to ensure qualified claims receive proper approval
**Customer Experience Goal:** Quick and painless claims process as primary retention driver

## Technology Leadership & Operational Excellence

### Operational Challenges & Solutions

**Current Challenge:** Information scattered across multiple platforms (Coda, ClickUp, BigQuery, Slack, Tableau)
**Primary Issues:**

**Strategic Need:** Centralized documentation system enabling quick access to accurate, up-to-date information
