## Slide 5: Hunt Performance - Transactional vs Multi-Touch

**Transactional Dramatically Outperforms Multi-Touch**

| Metric | Transactional | Multi-Touch Hunt | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Open Rate** | 15.31% | 7.68% | **+99%** |
| **Click Rate** | 4.86% | 0.59% | **+724% (8x!)** |
| **Click-to-Open** | 33.57% | 7.68% | **+337%** |
| **Unsubscribe** | 1.16% | 0.86% | +35% higher |

**Why Transactional Wins:**
- Timing: Immediate, while interest is hot
- Relevance: Direct response to quote action
- Urgency: Fresh information, recent decision
- Volume: Single message vs 14-message fatigue

**Key Takeaway:** First touch matters most

---

## Slide 6: Hunt Performance by Segment - Email

**Segment Comparison: Multi-Touch Hunt Campaigns**

| Segment | Volume | Open Rate | Click Rate | Click-to-Open | Unsub Rate |
|---------|--------|-----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Direct** | 4.1M (28%) | 8.57% ⭐ | 0.64% | 7.43% | 0.82% |
| **API Partner** | 8.9M (61%) | 7.89% | 0.58% | 7.35% | 1.01% ⚠️ |
| **Sam's Club** | 257K (2%) | 6.75% | 0.70% ⭐ | 10.36% ⭐ | 0.64% ✅ |
| **MSN** | 1.2M (9%) | 3.39% ⚠️ | 0.48% | 14.09% ⭐⭐ | 0.09% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Direct has highest opens** (8.57%) - best message-market fit
- **API Partner has highest volume** (61%) but highest unsubscribes (1.01%)
- **Sam's Club highest click rate** (0.70%) and lowest unsubscribes (0.64%)
- **MSN lowest opens** (3.39%) **but highest click-to-open** (14.09%)

---

## Slide 7: The MSN Paradox

**Lowest Opens, Highest Engagement**

**The Challenge:**
- Only 3.39% open rate (60% lower than Direct)
- Affecting 1.2M emails (9% of volume)

**The Opportunity:**
- 14.09% Click-to-Open rate (90% higher than Direct)
- 44.63% C-to-O on transactional emails
- Those who DO open are highly qualified and engaged

**Hypothesis:**
- Microsoft email filtering to Promotions/Other tabs
- Subject lines not optimized for Outlook
- Domain reputation issue with Microsoft servers

**Strategic Implication:**
If we can fix MSN open rates while maintaining C-to-O, we unlock massive engagement potential

## Slide 8: Hunt Transactional Performance by Segment

**First-Touch Email Performance**

| Segment | Sent | Open Rate | Click Rate | Click-to-Open |
|---------|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Direct** | 463K | 19.36% | 5.56% | 28.73% |
| **Sam's Club** | 27K | 18.91% | 5.60% | 29.63% |
| **API Partner** | 556K | 15.22% | 4.77% | 31.34% |
| **MSN** | 77K | 7.88% | 3.52% | 44.63% ⭐⭐ |

**Key Finding:**
MSN Click-to-Open is 44.63% - **nearly 1 in 2 who open will click**

**Pattern:** Same as multi-touch Hunt - MSN has engagement quality problem (opens), not engagement depth problem (clicks)

---

## Slide 9: Pre-Purchase SMS Performance

**SMS Delivery Strong, Click Tracking Broken**

| Segment | Sent | Delivery Rate | Clicks |
|---------|------|---------------|--------|
| **API Partner** | 1.57M | 91.47% | 0 ⚠️ |
| **Direct + MSN** | 1.15M | 94.07% | 0 ⚠️ |
| **Sam's Club** | 81K | 98.32% | 0 ⚠️ |

**Issues:**
- 0 clicks across ALL campaigns
- 2.9M SMS delivered, zero engagement tracked

**Possible Causes:**
1. No trackable links in SMS messages
2. Link tracking not configured
3. Reporting/attribution issue
4. SMS used for awareness, not clicks

**Action Required:** Verify SMS content and tracking setup

---

## Slide 10: Pre-Purchase Key Challenges

**Hunt Campaign Optimization Opportunities**

**1. API Partner Unsubscribe Rate (1.01%)**
- 61% of volume, highest unsubscribe rate
- 87,876 unsubscribes over 90 days (71% of total)
- Hypothesis: Comparison shoppers less committed

**2. MSN Open Rate Crisis (3.39%)**
- 2.4x lower than Direct despite hot clickers
- Potential: 2x engagement if we solve inbox placement

**3. SMS Click Tracking Gap**
- 2.9M SMS delivered, 0 clicks tracked
- Cannot measure SMS effectiveness

**4. Transactional vs Nurture Tension**
- 8x click rate advantage for single message
- 14-message journey may be fatiguing

---

## Slide 11: Post-Purchase Overview

**Golden Journey: Drive Policy Usage for Retention**

**Core Hypothesis:** Customers who use their policies retain better

**Campaign Structure:**

**1. Policy Active Requirements (Campaigns 83, 84)**
- Notify when coverage begins
- Critical transactional moment
- 130K emails, 50K SMS (90 days)

**2. US Golden Journey (Campaign 66)**
- Claims education, app adoption, policy management
- Multi-message retention driver
- 479K emails (90 days)

**3. Canada Golden Journey (Campaign 167)**
- Canada-specific retention journey
- 4.8K emails (90 days)

---

## Slide 12: Post-Purchase Performance Overview

**Policyholders Are 3-9x More Engaged Than Quoters**

| Campaign | Open Rate | Click Rate | Click-to-Open | Volume |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| **Canada Golden** | 37.87% ⭐⭐ | 10.75% ⭐⭐ | 28.39% | 4.8K |
| **Policy Active** | 36.12% ⭐⭐ | 14.76% ⭐⭐ | 40.85% ⭐⭐ | 130K |
| **US Golden** | 23.72% ⭐ | 5.51% ⭐ | 23.24% | 479K |
| *Hunt Multi-Touch* | *7.68%* | *0.59%* | *7.68%* | *14.4M* |

**Comparison to Pre-Purchase:**
- Golden Journey opens: +209% vs Hunt
- Golden Journey clicks: +834% vs Hunt
- Unsubscribe rate: -70% lower (0.26% vs 0.86%)

**Key Insight:** Active policyholders are invested in learning to use their policy

---

## Slide 13: Policy Active Requirements - The Critical Moment

**When Coverage Begins: Exceptional Engagement**

**Email Performance (Campaign 83):**
- 36.12% open rate (2.4x Hunt transactional)
- 14.76% click rate (nearly 15 in 100 click)
- 40.85% Click-to-Open (2 in 5 who open will click)
- 0.25% unsubscribe rate (customers WANT this message)

**Why It Performs So Well:**
1. **Critical information** - Customers waiting for coverage to start
2. **Expected message** - They know it's coming
3. **High relevance** - Directly impacts ability to file claims
4. **Clear next step** - Use your coverage
5. **Emotional moment** - Relief that protection is active

**Strategic Value:** This is the "welcome to active coverage" moment - prime opportunity to drive app adoption and claims education

---

## Slide 14: US Golden Journey Performance

**Multi-Message Retention Driver**

**Campaign 66 (Version 3.1.8):**
- 479K emails over 90 days (~5,322/day)
- 23.72% open rate (+209% vs Hunt)
- 5.51% click rate (+834% vs Hunt)
- 0.26% unsubscribe rate (customers value content)

**Engagement Volume:**
- 111,890 opens (~1,243/day)
- 26,008 clicks (~289/day)
- 23.24% of openers will click

**What This Means:**
- Every day, ~1,243 customers engage with retention content
- Every day, ~289 customers take action
- Low unsubscribes = content is valued, not fatiguing

**Unknown:** Journey structure, message themes, timing (too large to retrieve in single call)

---

## Slide 15: Canada vs US - The Performance Gap

**Canada Outperforms US by 60-95%**

| Metric | Canada | US | Gap |
|--------|--------|-----|-----|
| **Open Rate** | 37.87% | 23.72% | **+60%** |
| **Click Rate** | 10.75% | 5.51% | **+95%** |
| **Click-to-Open** | 28.39% | 23.24% | +22% |
| **Delivery** | 99.83% | 98.47% | +1.4% |
| **Unsubscribe** | 0.17% | 0.26% | -35% better |

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Market maturity** - Less saturated, less email fatigue
2. **Content relevance** - Canada-specific messaging resonates better
3. **Customer quality** - Early adopters, more engaged
4. **Sample size** - 4.8K vs 479K emails (variance possible)

**Strategic Opportunity:** If Canada performance is replicable, US could double click rates

## Slide 18: Strategic Priorities & Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (This Week)**

**Pre-Purchase:**
1. **Fix MSN inbox placement** - A/B test subject lines for Outlook optimization
2. **Investigate SMS click tracking** - Verify links and tracking setup
3. **API Partner segmentation** - Analyze unsubscribe patterns by partner

**Post-Purchase:**

5. **Golden Journey message audit** - Individual message performance analysis
6. **Optimize Policy Active CTAs** - Maximize critical activation moment

**Long-Term Strategy (This Quarter)**

**Pre-Purchase:**
- Test condensed Hunt journey (reduce from 14 messages)
- Segment API partners by quality/engagement
- MSN-specific subject line optimization program

**Post-Purchase:**
- Retention correlation analysis (do Golden Journey engagers retain better?)
- Test Canada content approach in US market
- Journey length optimization (optimal messages for retention)

---

**Questions for Discussion**

1. Should we prioritize Canada content analysis or US message audit first?
2. What's the business impact of fixing MSN open rates (1.2M emails at 3% vs potential 8%)?
3. How do we measure Golden Journey's retention impact?
4. Should we reduce Hunt journey length based on transactional performance?
