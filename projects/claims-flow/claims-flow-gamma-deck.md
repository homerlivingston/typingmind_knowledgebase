# Reimagining Claims at Spot
## A Strategic Initiative to Drive Retention Through Claims Excellence

---

## Why This Matters

**Claims satisfaction is our #1 retention driver**

- 45% of cancellations cite denied claims
- 28% disappointed with reimbursement amounts
- Current: 85-87% approval rate, 6-7 day processing, ~50% direct deposit
- Strategic Priority #3: App & Claims Experience Redesign

---

## The Vision

**Current State:**
Claims buried in portal, form-heavy, limited visibility, reactive support

**Future State:**
Photo-first AI submission, always-visible progress bar, proactive pre-vet education

**Core Principle:**
Transparency, proactive support, contextual help, respect customer choices

---

## Submitting a New Claim
### Entry Point & Photo-First Upload

**Photo-first submission:**
- Invoice photos + Medical records (conditional)
- AI validates pet name, hospital, vet notes
- Multiple photos, guidance modal with examples

---

## AI Extraction & Validation

**AI auto-populates claim fields from photos**

**Customer reviews editable screen with:**
- Warning symbol (⚠️) on <90% confident fields
- Override option: "The info is there, submit anyways"
- Manual entry if extraction fails

**Smart medical records logic:**
- Optional if claim filed in past 6 months
- Required for new/different conditions
