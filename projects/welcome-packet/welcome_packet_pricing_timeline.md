## Critical Path & Dependencies

### High-Risk Items (Could Delay Launch)

1. **Engineering Bandwidth** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - FTP integration and automated data feed
   - If engineering resources unavailable, consider manual process for pilot
   - **Mitigation:** Secure engineering commitment in Week 1

2. **Bandana Lead Time** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - 2-3 week production + 1 week shipping
   - Order must be placed by end of Week 2
   - **Mitigation:** Pre-order samples in Week 1, place bulk order immediately upon approval

3. **Lake Erie Template Specifications**
   - Design cannot finalize until template received
   - **Mitigation:** Contact Larry in first 2 days of Week 1

4. **Legal/Compliance Review**
   - Tri-fold content may require legal approval
   - **Mitigation:** Submit for review in Week 2, build in 3-5 day review window

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **QR Code Landing Pages**
   - Need mobile-optimized pages live before production
   - **Mitigation:** Use existing welcome resources or simple landing pages

2. **CS Team Availability**
   - Training and readiness for customer questions
   - **Mitigation:** Leverage existing onboarding materials, simple FAQ doc

3. **Data Quality**
   - Accurate customer data for personalization
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive testing in Week 3, fallback to non-personalized version if issues

---

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate (Launch Phase)
1. **Negotiate bulk bandana pricing:** Target $1.75-$2.00 per unit at 10K+ volume
2. **Optimize postage:** Ensure packet stays under 4 oz to avoid higher rates
3. **Domestic vs. overseas bandanas:** Pilot with domestic, transition to overseas for 30% savings

### Post-Launch (Months 2-6)
1. **A/B test packet variations:** Test with/without bandana to measure ROI impact
2. **Segmentation strategy:** Premium packets for high-AOV customers, simplified for lower-AOV
3. **Digital-first option:** Offer email-only welcome experience, send physical only if requested
4. **Annual billing preference:** Prioritize packets to monthly billing customers (higher churn risk)

### Long-Term (6-12 Months)
1. **Multi-pet discounts:** Shared packet for multi-pet households
2. **Partner co-marketing:** Offset costs with vet clinic or pet brand partnerships
3. **Sustainability:** Eco-friendly materials may reduce costs and improve brand perception
