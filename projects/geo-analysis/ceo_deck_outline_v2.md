# Spot Pet Insurance: State of GEO
## CEO Deck | December 2, 2025

---

## Slide 1: What is GEO & Why It Matters

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is how we ensure Spot appears when consumers ask AI assistants about pet insurance.

**The Shift:** Consumers increasingly use ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews to research purchases instead of traditional search. When someone asks "what's the best pet insurance?", we need Spot in that answer.

**Our Focus Platforms:**
- **ChatGPT** — Leading conversational AI, cites 30 Spot pages
- **Google AI Overviews** — Integrated into Google Search results

**Current Position:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall AI Visibility | 40% (+2% WoW) |
| ChatGPT Visibility | 42% |
| Google AI Overviews Visibility | 37% |
| Market Position | #3 (behind Pets Best, Lemonade) |
| Brand Mentions | 1,086 (+57 WoW — highest growth) |

**The Opportunity:** We're the fastest-growing brand in AI visibility. Focused optimization can help us maintain and extend this momentum.

## Slide 2: Platform Focus — ChatGPT & Google AI Overviews

**Why These Two Platforms:**
- ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews represent the highest-impact consumer touchpoints
- ChatGPT users are actively researching purchases and seeking recommendations
- Google AI Overviews appear directly in search results, influencing purchase decisions at the moment of intent

**Our Performance on Priority Platforms:**

| Platform | Visibility | Spot Pages Cited | Mentions |
|----------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **ChatGPT** | 42% | 30 | 191 |
| **Google AI Overviews** | 37% | 11 | 166 |

**Key Insight:** ChatGPT cites the most Spot pages (30), indicating our content resonates well with this platform. Google AI Overviews cites fewer pages (11) — an optimization opportunity.

## Slide 3: Competitive Landscape

**Overall Market Position:**

| Rank | Brand | Visibility | WoW Change |
|------|-------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Pets Best | 51% | -1% |
| 2 | Lemonade | 41% | +1% |
| **3** | **Spot** | **40%** | **+2%** |
| 4 | Figo | 29% | +2% |
| 5 | Trupanion | 27% | -1% |

**Momentum:** Spot has the strongest week-over-week growth in both visibility (+2%) and mentions (+57). Top competitors Pets Best and Trupanion are declining.

**On Our Priority Platforms:**
- ChatGPT: Spot ranks competitively at 42% visibility
- Google AI Overviews: Room to improve from 37%

## Slide 4: Winning Topics — ChatGPT & Google AI Overviews

**Topics Where We Perform Well (with Search Volume Context):**

| Topic | ChatGPT | AI Overviews | Monthly Search Volume |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Pet Insurance for Dogs and Cats | 60% | 61% | **90,462** |
| Spot Pet Insurance (Brand Queries) | 57% | 41% | **75,404** |
| Pet Insurance with No Network Restrictions | 69% | 29% | **72,454** |
| Multi-Pet Insurance Plans | 44% | 44% | 40,205 |

**Why This Matters:**
- Our top 3 performing topics represent **238K+ monthly searches** — significant consumer demand
- "Dogs and Cats" is the highest-volume topic (90K) and we lead on both platforms
- Brand queries (75K) show strong direct interest in Spot
- "No Network Restrictions" is high-volume (72K) and a key differentiator

**Why We Win:**
- Flexibility messaging resonates — "flexible and customizable plans" appears in 250+ AI mentions
- Multi-pet discounts frequently cited (274 mentions)
- "Any licensed vet" positioning is memorable and unique

## Slide 5: Topic Gaps — Where We Need Improvement

**Underperforming Topics (Sorted by Search Volume):**

| Topic | ChatGPT | AI Overviews | Monthly Search Volume |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Puppy and Kitten Insurance | 36% | 33% | **54,012** |
| Accident and Illness Pet Coverage | 32% | 32% | **50,271** |
| Hereditary and Chronic Conditions | 22% | 36% | 27,839 |
| Employer Pet Insurance Benefits | 28% | 24% | 27,722 |

**The Opportunity Cost:**
- Puppy/Kitten and Accident/Illness represent **104K+ monthly searches** — our two biggest visibility gaps
- These are core product topics where we should be competitive
- Low visibility here means competitors are capturing high-intent prospects

**Priority Focus:**
- **Puppy and Kitten Insurance** (54K searches) — High volume, life-stage content opportunity
- **Accident and Illness Coverage** (50K searches) — Core product, should be a strength

## Slide 7: Strategy Overview — 2 Pillars

**Pillar 1: Owned Content Optimization**
Make spotpet.com more citable and authoritative for AI platforms

**Pillar 2: Third-Party Presence**
Strengthen coverage on high-authority finance publications that AI platforms trust

---

**Our Approach:**
- This is Spot's first structured GEO initiative
- We will establish baseline metrics and learn what works before setting aggressive targets
- Focus on ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews as primary success indicators
- Build sustainable processes rather than one-time fixes

---

## Slide 8: Content Optimization — Make spotpet.com AI-Ready

**Current State:** 59 Spot pages cited by AI platforms, generating 208 responses

**Actions:**

**1. Expand Topic-Specific Landing Pages**
Create additional content within high-opportunity categories:
- Coverage types (hereditary conditions, chronic illness, accident coverage)
- Pet life stages (puppies, kittens, senior pets)
- Value propositions (multi-pet savings, wellness options, customization)
- Use cases (first-time pet owners, breed-specific needs)

**2. Improve Structured Data Markup**
Enhance existing schema implementation:
- Expand FAQ schema coverage across product pages
- Add more specific Review schema with third-party ratings
- Improve internal linking between related content

**3. Optimize for AI Snippet Extraction**
- Add clear, quotable summary statements at top of pages
- Include comparison tables with specific data points
- Ensure key differentiators (90% reimbursement, 2-day claims, no network restrictions) are prominently featured

## Slide 9: Third-Party Presence Strategy

**Key Insight:** AI platforms heavily favor high-authority finance publications when answering insurance questions. Sources like CNBC (DR 92), Bankrate (DR 90), and NerdWallet (DR 90) are cited hundreds of times.

**Finance Publication Opportunity:**
- Pursue PR and editorial coverage with finance-focused outlets
- Position Spot spokespeople as pet insurance industry experts
- Provide data and insights for trend pieces on pet ownership costs
- Target: Bankrate, CBS MoneyWatch, Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch

**Reddit Presence:**
- Reddit (DR 95) shows 36 citation opportunities where competitors appear but Spot doesn't
- Continue authentic community engagement in pet-focused subreddits
- Create shareable, educational content that naturally gets referenced in discussions

**Note:** Our existing aggregator partnerships (Pawlicy, Forbes, MoneyGeek) are already performing well — no major changes needed there.

## Slide 10: Initial Goals — Conservative Approach

**Philosophy:** This is our first GEO initiative. We need to establish baselines and learn before committing to aggressive targets.

**6-Month Goals (Focus Platforms):**

| Metric | Current | 6-Month Target |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| ChatGPT Visibility | 42% | 45% |
| Google AI Overviews Visibility | 37% | 40% |
| Combined Priority Platform Avg | 40% | 42% |
| Spot Pages Cited | 59 | 75 |

**Why Conservative:**
- GEO is new territory — we don't yet know our content velocity or what moves the needle
- These platforms update their models unpredictably
- We want wins we can build on, not missed targets that demoralize the team

**Success Indicators Beyond Visibility:**
- Improved ranking position when mentioned (currently avg 3.7)
- More Spot pages being cited by AI platforms
- Consistent week-over-week growth maintained

**Resource Reality:**
