# Spot Pet Insurance: State of GEO
## CEO Deck Outline | December 2, 2025

---

# PART 1: CURRENT POSITION (Slides 1-9)

---

## Slide 1: Executive Summary - GEO Scorecard

**Key Metrics at a Glance:**
- AI Visibility: **40%** (+2% WoW)
- Market Position: **#3** (behind Pets Best 51%, Lemonade 41%)
- Brand Mentions: **1,086** (+57 WoW - highest growth in market)
- Average Rank: **3.7** (Top 3 in 51.5% of responses)
- Sentiment: **97%+ positive** across all themes

**The Story:** Spot is the fastest-growing brand in AI visibility week-over-week, but still trails two competitors. Strong momentum with significant room to capture market share.

---

## Slide 2: Competitive Landscape - Where We Stand

**Visibility Rankings:**

| Rank | Brand | Visibility | WoW Change | Mentions |
|------|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Pets Best | 51% | -1% | 1,388 |
| 2 | Lemonade | 41% | +1% | 1,112 |
| **3** | **Spot** | **40%** | **+2%** | **1,086** |
| 4 | Figo | 29% | +2% | 785 |
| 5 | Trupanion | 27% | -1% | 723 |

**Key Insight:** Top competitors (Pets Best, Trupanion) are declining while Spot shows strongest growth. Gap to #1 is 11 points - closeable with focused effort.

---

## Slide 3: Platform Performance - Where We Win

**Strongest Platforms:**

| Platform | Visibility | Why We Win |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Microsoft Copilot | **56%** | Highest visibility - enterprise users |
| Gemini | **48%** | Strong Google ecosystem presence |
| ChatGPT | **42%** | Most Spot pages cited (30) |
| Google AI Mode | **41%** | Search integration |

**Weakest Platform:**
- Perplexity: Only **16%** despite citing 27 Spot pages

**Opportunity:** Perplexity cites our content but doesn't recommend us - optimization gap.

---

## Slide 4: Platform Performance - Citation Gap Problem

**The Gemini Paradox:**
- 48% visibility but only **1 Spot page cited**
- Relying almost entirely on 3rd party sources
- Risk: We don't control the narrative

**Platform Citation Comparison:**

| Platform | Visibility | Our Pages Cited |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| ChatGPT | 42% | 30 |
| Perplexity | 16% | 27 |
| Copilot | 56% | 14 |
| Google AI Overviews | 37% | 11 |
| Google AI Mode | 41% | 9 |
| **Gemini** | **48%** | **1** |

**Risk:** High visibility without citation control = vulnerable to narrative shift.

---

## Slide 5: Topic Dominance - Where We're Winning

**Topics with 70%+ Visibility (on at least one platform):**

| Topic | Best Platform | Visibility |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Multi-Pet Insurance Plans | Copilot | **93%** |
| No Network Restrictions | Copilot | **71%** |
| Pet Insurance for Dogs & Cats | Gemini | **73%** |
| Perks and Discounts | Google AI Mode | **70%** |

**Why We Win Here:**
- Multi-pet discount messaging is strong (274 theme mentions)
- "No network restrictions" is a key differentiator (32 theme mentions)
- Flexibility/customization themes dominate (1,111 mentions)

---

## Slide 6: Topic Gaps - Where We're Losing

**Underperforming Topics:**

| Topic | Avg Visibility | Problem |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Fast Claims Processing | **20%** (excl. ChatGPT) | Only ChatGPT sees us as fast |
| Employer Benefits | **22%** | Weak across ALL platforms |
| Accident & Illness Coverage | **30%** | Core product, low visibility |

**The Claims Speed Problem:**
- Google AI Mode: **9%**
- Copilot: **20%**
- Gemini: **17%**
- ChatGPT: **50%** (outlier)

**Impact:** Claims speed is a top purchase driver - we're invisible on this topic.

---

## Slide 7: Brand Perception - What AI Says About Us

**Top Positive Themes (97%+ positive sentiment):**

| Theme | Mentions | Key Messages |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Feature Variety & Customization | 1,111 | Flexible plans, unlimited options |
| Core Functionality | 777 | Pre-existing conditions, telehealth, any vet |
| Promotions & Loyalty | 380 | Multi-pet discounts |
| Customer Ratings | 227 | Forbes 4.1, top-rated |
| Price Competitiveness | 143 | Affordable, budget-friendly |

**What AI Loves About Spot:**
- Flexible and customizable plans
- Coverage for curable pre-existing conditions
- 24/7 telehealth support
- No network restrictions
- No upper age limit

---

## Slide 8: Brand Perception - Minor Concerns to Monitor

**Negative Themes (very low volume but notable):**

| Concern | Mentions | Competitor Advantage |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Pay vet upfront (no direct pay) | 3 | Trupanion has VetDirect Pay |
| Pre-existing exclusions | 2 | Industry standard |
| Waiting periods | 2 | Some competitors shorter |

**The Direct Pay Gap:**
Trupanion's VetDirect Pay is cited as fastest claims solution. We lack this capability.

---

## Slide 9: Citation Source Analysis - Who's Talking About Us

**Top Sources Driving Our Visibility:**

| Source | Responses | DR | Relationship |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------------|
| pawlicy.com | 1,033 | 72 | Affiliate/Comparison |
| forbes.com | 574 | 94 | Editorial |
| moneygeek.com | 525 | 77 | Editorial |
| cnbc.com | 523 | 92 | Editorial |
| spotpet.com | 208 | 64 | Owned |

**The Problem:** Our owned domain (spotpet.com) generates only 208 responses vs. pawlicy.com at 1,033. Third parties control our narrative.

**Competitor Domain Comparison:**
- embracepetinsurance.com: 380 responses
- fetchpet.com: 273 responses
- **spotpet.com: 208 responses**

## Slide 14: Third-Party Presence - Reddit Strategy

## Slide 17: Platform-Specific Optimization

**Perplexity Opportunity:**

**Actions for Perplexity:**
1. Ensure cited pages have clear, authoritative answers
2. Add more structured data and FAQs
3. Improve page load speed and mobile experience

**Gemini Gap:**
- 48% visibility but only 1 Spot page cited
