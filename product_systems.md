# Product Systems - Spot Pet Insurance

## Strategic Product Framework for $350M GWP

### Product Portfolio Strategy
**Primary Objective:** Optimize plan configuration and wellness adoption to drive AOV growth
**Operational Context:** Product features and pricing controlled by external underwriter (IPG)
**Strategic Focus:** Quote form optimization and upselling algorithms supporting conversion × retention × AOV formula
**Testing Approach:** Limited product testing due to underwriter control, focus on recommendation and presentation optimization

## Core Product Offerings

### Accident + Illness Plans (Primary Revenue Driver)
**Market Share:** Vast majority of policy book
**Strategic Importance:** Core revenue driver for GWP growth
**Competitive Position:** Coverage essentially identical to competitors
**Differentiation:** Premium brand positioning through service excellence and customer experience

### Accident-Only Plans (Secondary Offering)
**Market Position:** Entry-level budget option
**Customer Segment:** Price-sensitive pet owners
**Strategic Role:** Maintain competitive portfolio while focusing resources on higher-AOV products
**Volume Impact:** Minority of total policies

## Wellness Add-On Strategy

### Wellness Adoption Performance (Past 6 Months)
**Platinum Coverage:** 28% of customers (highest AOV impact)
**Gold Coverage:** 22% of customers (moderate AOV increase)
**No Wellness:** ~50% of customers (base AOV)
**Strategic Insight:** 50% wellness adoption rate provides significant AOV optimization opportunity

### Wellness vs Retention Trade-off
**AOV Impact:** Wellness customers generate commensurately higher monthly premiums
**Retention Challenge:** Wellness customers retain slightly worse than base coverage
**Strategic Decision:** Accept retention trade-off for AOV benefits supporting GWP target
**Optimization Focus:** Balance wellness upselling with retention quality

## Pricing Strategy & AOV Optimization

### Pricing Model Variables
**Pricing Formula Components:**
- **Pet Age:** Primary driver of risk-based pricing
- **Breed:** Expensive dog breeds cost more (higher treatment costs drive higher premiums)
- **Location:** Geographic risk and cost variations
- **Plan Type:** Accident-only vs Accident + Illness vs Wellness add-ons
- **Species:** Dogs ($52.78 AOV) vs Cats ($31.41 AOV) - 68% premium difference
- **Gender:** Risk-based pricing adjustments

### Species-Based AOV Strategy
**Dog Prioritization:** $52.78 average monthly premium drives species-focused acquisition strategy
**Cat Positioning:** $31.41 average monthly premium - secondary priority for optimization resources
**Strategic Impact:** Dog acquisition receives priority in testing and feature development due to AOV differential

### Plan Configuration Upselling Strategy
**Default Strategy:** Lower-cost plans to avoid price shock and maximize conversion
**Intelligent Recommendations:** Breed and species-based upselling to higher coverage plans
**Optimization Challenge:** Balance between upselling and conversion - sometimes requires downselling from "Cadillac" plans
**Testing Focus:** Quote form presentation and recommendation algorithms for AOV optimization

## Annual Billing Strategy

### Annual vs Monthly Payment Optimization
**Current Annual Adoption:** 9% of new customers choose annual billing
**Annual Billing Incentive:** $24 discount for annual payment
**Strategic Objective:** Increase annual billing adoption to improve both AOV and retention
**Retention Benefit:** Annual billing customers show improved retention patterns
**Cash Flow Advantage:** Upfront annual payments support business cash flow and reduce churn risk

## Multi-Pet Strategy

### Add-a-Pet Journey Optimization
**Current Offering:** "Add another pet and save 10%" promotion on quote form
**Strategic Priority:** Multi-pet households drive significantly higher lifetime value
**Development Focus:** Add-a-pet journey identified as Priority #1 development initiative
**Conversion Advantage:** Existing customers have highest conversion propensity for additional pets
**AOV Impact:** Multi-pet households generate substantially higher monthly premiums

## Underwriting & Operational Constraints

### External Underwriter Partnership (IPG)
**Operational Reality:** Underwriting handled entirely by external partner IPG
**Product Control:** Limited control over pricing, product features, and coverage decisions
**Strategic Limitation:** Cannot independently adjust pricing or coverage to optimize conversion/retention
**Customer Handoff:** Post-purchase customers primarily managed by IPG with limited Spot touchpoints
**Communication Strategy:** Post-purchase emails and SMS campaigns as primary customer engagement method

### Testing & Optimization Within Constraints
**Testing Philosophy:** Test everything possible within operational limitations
**Rare Product Testing:** When product control is available, almost always test unless no-brainer feature
**Focus Areas:** Quote form presentation, plan recommendation algorithms, and customer communication optimization
**Strategic Priority:** Maximize optimization within available control points

### Claims Processing & Customer Experience

**Claims Performance:**
- **Processing Time:** 6-7 days average (5 controllable days)
- **Success Rate:** 87-99% of claims processed successfully
- **Average Claim Amount:** $430.97 (much lower than industry average)
- **Processing Improvement:** Reduced from 5+ days (summer 2024) to 2-day target

## Claims Processing & Customer Experience Constraints

### Claims Processing Reality
**Processing Control:** Limited visibility and control over claims process (handled by IPG underwriter)
**Performance Metrics:** 85% claims approval rate with 2-3 day processing target
**Customer Experience Impact:** Claims experience is primary retention driver but largely outside Spot's direct control
**Strategic Challenge:** Optimize customer-facing claims experience within operational constraints
**Communication Focus:** Enhance customer communication and expectation management around claims process

### Automated Claims Processing
**Current Capability:** Automated processing available for "open and shut" claims only
**Operational Limitation:** Complex claims require manual review by IPG team
**Strategic Opportunity:** Maximize utilization of existing automation for eligible claims
**Customer Benefit:** Faster processing for straightforward claim types
**Performance Impact:** Automated claims processing improves overall turnaround times

## Product Strategy Within Operational Reality

### Strategic Focus Areas
**Quote Form Optimization:** Primary area of product influence and testing
**Plan Presentation:** Algorithm optimization for breed and species-based recommendations
**Customer Communication:** Post-purchase engagement through email and SMS campaigns
**Annual Billing Promotion:** Increase 9% adoption rate through incentives and messaging
**Multi-Pet Upselling:** Optimize add-a-pet journey for highest-value customer acquisition

### Competitive Product Positioning
**Coverage Parity:** Product features essentially identical to all major competitors
**Service Differentiation:** Premium brand positioning through customer experience excellence
**Claims Advantage:** 2-3 day processing vs industry standards as key differentiator
**Pricing Strategy:** Competitive parity maintained across all plan configurations
**Value Proposition:** Focus on service quality and brand trust rather than unique product features
