# Spot Perks Key Insights Summary

## Core Program Insights

### The Perks Paradox
Spot Perks succeeds as a **perception-based marketing tool** rather than a traditional benefits program:
- **Extremely low usage rates** (0.1% based on Fi data)
- **High conversion impact** (5-34% QTP improvements)
- **Strong retention effects** for engaged users
- **99.9% of customers** influenced by program never actually use perks

### Value Creation Mechanism
- **87% of value**: Pre-purchase conversion influence through perceived abundance
- **13% of value**: Actual user engagement and retention
- **Low fulfillment costs** due to minimal usage create exceptional ROI

## Critical Success Patterns

### Abundance > Exclusivity
- **6-perk displays**: 14% QTP improvement
- **Single exclusive perks**: 3-5.3% QTP improvement
- **Key insight**: Perceived abundance outperforms perceived exclusivity for conversion

### Fresh Content > Perfect Timing
- **PERKS_BLAST** (quarterly fresh content): 11% churn reduction
- **Golden Day 12** (fixed cadence): Variable results by cohort
- **Key insight**: New perk announcements more effective than timing optimization

### Horizontal Cards > Core Integration
- **Standard horizontal perk cards**: Strong performance
- **Core-aligned presentation**: Performed worse than standard format
- **Key insight**: Perks work better as distinct value-adds, not integrated benefits

## What Works vs What Doesn't

### Proven Successes
- **Multi-perk quote form displays** (14% QTP improvement)
- **Fresh quarterly email content** (11% churn reduction)
- **Social influencer + perks** (34% QTP improvement, 38% lower CPP)
- **3-6 month cohort targeting** (8% churn reduction)

### Proven Failures
- **Lapsed journey perks**: Underperformed control across all variants
- **Core-aligned formatting**: Confused value proposition
- **Fixed timing approaches**: Less effective than need-based deployment
- **Single perk focus**: Reduced perceived value vs multi-perk abundance

## Strategic Principles

### Focus on Perception Over Usage
- Accept low usage rates as normal for this program type
- Optimize for conversion influence rather than engagement metrics
- Leverage psychological value creation over transactional benefits

### Timing Strategy
- **Pre-purchase**: Maximize perk visibility in quote form ($2500+ value anchoring)
- **0-3 months**: Minimal perk focus, emphasize core insurance value
- **3-6 months**: Intensive perk engagement (proven 8% retention boost)
- **6+ months**: Fresh content and new partner introductions

### Partner Strategy
- Prioritize data-sharing partnerships (Fi model) for optimization feedback
- Focus on high-value, frequently-used partners over quantity
- Maintain account number gates while accepting some code leakage

## Measurement Insights

### Lost Capabilities
- **No control groups** for current PERKS_BLAST campaigns
- **Limited partner data** except Fi partnership
- **Cannot measure** current program effectiveness vs baseline

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Quote form impact**: 5-14% QTP improvement targets
- **Email retention**: 8-11% churn reduction targets
- **Usage proxies**: Email opens/clicks as engagement indicators

## Competitive Context

### Market Position
- Spot was **first or among first** to offer pet insurance perks programs
- **Many competitors** have since followed suit
- **Differentiation challenge**: Standing out in crowded perk landscape

### Value Proposition
- **Curation and convenience** rather than exclusivity
- **Comprehensive benefits package** perception
- **$2500+ value anchoring** creates strong conversion influence

## Implementation Constraints

### Partner Pipeline Bottleneck
- **Sales team bandwidth** limits fresh content generation
- **Quarterly cadence** constrained by partner deal acquisition
- **Currently unable** to execute planned campaigns due to insufficient new perks

### Technology Limitations
- **Account number gates** as primary protection mechanism
- **Limited usage tracking** across most partnerships
- **Manual campaign management** without automated optimization

### Current Performance Challenges
- **Performance degradation**: PERKS_BLAST showing 4.5% churn reduction vs Golden Day 12's 11%
- **Account gate friction**: Only exclusivity mechanism for public coupon codes creates access barrier
- **SMS messaging learning**: Perks-first messaging underperformed urgency messaging by 10%

- **30% household income $25-50k** (budget-conscious segment)

### Experiment Implications
