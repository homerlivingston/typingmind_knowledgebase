# Corrected Spot Perks Strategy - Post Data Correction

## CRITICAL DATA CORRECTION

**Previous Incorrect Assumption**: Perks program showing 4.5% churn reduction, aiming to recover to 11%

**Actual September 2024 Data**:
- **3-6 months**: Control 8.26% → Test 8.71% (**perks INCREASE churn by 0.45%**)
- **9-12 months**: Control 13.59% → Test 12.86% (**perks decrease churn by 0.73%**)
- **24+ months**: Control 13.91% → Test 14.36% (**perks increase churn by 0.45%**)

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### **Fundamental Problem Identified**
Current perk communications are **actively harmful** in the target 3-6 month demographic, not underperforming as previously assumed.

### **Revised Strategic Objective**
- **Old Goal**: Recover lost retention performance from 4.5% to 11%
- **New Goal**: Fix fundamentally broken perk approach that increases churn in key cohorts

### **Cohort Strategy Revision**
- **3-6 months**: Complete messaging/timing redesign required (currently harmful)
- **9-12 months**: Optimization opportunity exists (currently working)
- **24+ months**: Consider eliminating perk communications (currently harmful)

## EXPERIMENT PORTFOLIO CHANGES

### **DELETED EXPERIMENTS** (False Foundation)
1. ~~QW1: Golden Journey Perk Integration~~ → Replaced with Communication Redesign
2. ~~QW4: 3-6 Month Email Timing Optimization~~ → Replaced with 9-12 Month Focus
3. ~~C4: Dynamic Retention Triggers~~ → Timing hypothesis invalid
4. ~~R2: Golden Journey Integration~~ → Duplicate of false premise
5. ~~R5: Email Timing Optimization~~ → Based on incorrect performance data

### **REVISED EXPERIMENTS** (Corrected Foundation)
1. **QW1: Perk Communication Fundamental Redesign** - Address why current messaging increases churn
2. **QW4: 9-12 Month Cohort Optimization** - Focus on cohort that responds positively
3. **C2: Proactive Personalization** - Could fix the messaging problem causing churn
4. **C4: Churn Cause Analysis** - Understand why perks increase churn in 3-6 months

### **RETAINED EXPERIMENTS** (Still Valid)
1. **QW2: Hunt Journey Banner Optimization** - UTQ/QTP improvement still valuable
2. **QW3: Spot-Perks Page UX** - Access friction remains real issue
3. **QW5: Homepage Prominence** - Awareness building for quote conversion
4. **C1: Account Gate Elimination** - Access barriers still problematic
5. **C3: Integrated Portal** - Better experience regardless of current effectiveness

## NEW EXPERIMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### **High Priority: Problem Diagnosis**
1. **Perk Message Audit** - Identify specific content causing churn increase
2. **Customer Feedback Analysis** - Why do 3-6 month customers react negatively?
3. **Competitive Messaging Analysis** - How do other companies present perks without harm?

### **Medium Priority: Alternative Approaches**
1. **No-Perk Control Testing** - Measure baseline without any perk communications
2. **Timing Elimination Test** - Remove perks from 3-6 month journey entirely
3. **Value Perception Research** - When/how should perks be introduced?

## REVISED SUCCESS METRICS

### **Primary Metrics** (Changed Focus)
- **3-6 Month Churn**: Reduce from current 8.71% with perks to below 8.26% control level
- **9-12 Month Optimization**: Improve upon current 0.73% churn reduction
- **Overall Portfolio**: Eliminate net negative impact of perk program

### **Secondary Metrics**
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Ensure perk changes don't harm brand perception
- **Acquisition Impact**: Maintain quote form conversion benefits (14% improvement)
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce wasted resources on counterproductive communications

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### **Week 1-2: Emergency Assessment**
- Implement 50% holdout control for 3-6 month perk communications
- Begin message audit to identify harmful content
- Launch 9-12 month optimization where data shows effectiveness

### **Week 3-4: Strategic Redesign**
- Complete fundamental messaging redesign based on audit findings
- Test alternative perk introduction timing/methods
- Continue optimization of responsive cohorts (9-12 months)

This correction fundamentally changes the experiment strategy from "performance recovery" to "problem resolution" with focus on cohorts that actually respond positively to perk communications.
