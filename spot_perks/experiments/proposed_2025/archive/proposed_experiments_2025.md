## COMPLEX EXPERIMENTS (Big Swings - Higher Resource, Higher Upside)

### **C1: Account Gate Elimination Study**
**Timeline**: 2-3 months | **Priority**: High | **Target**: All tenure cohorts

**Hypothesis**: Eliminating friction will increase perk usage, leading to stronger retention benefits without significantly impacting perceived exclusivity.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current account number gate on spotpet.com/spot-perks
- **Test A**: Email + last 4 policy digits authentication
- **Test B**: Magic link email authentication (one-click access)
- **Test C**: Progressive access (basic perks open, premium gated)

**Primary Metric**: 3-6 month cohort churn rate
**Secondary Metrics**: Perk page engagement, code redemption proxies, overall retention across all cohorts

**Supporting Research**: Fi data shows meaningful retention when customers actually engage with perks. Current account gate creates barrier that may prevent the engagement needed for retention benefits.

### **C2: Proactive Perk Delivery System**
**Timeline**: 2-3 months | **Priority**: High | **Target**: 3-6 month cohort

**Hypothesis**: Delivering personalized perks proactively based on customer profiles will increase engagement and retention more than reactive communications.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current PERKS_BLAST approach (everyone gets same email)
- **Test A**: Resonate-driven personalization (health-conscious get wellness perks, budget-conscious get savings-focused)
- **Test B**: Behavioral triggers (post-claim perks, anniversary perks, engagement-based)
- **Test C**: Smart timing (optimal day/time based on individual engagement patterns)

**Primary Metric**: 3-6 month cohort churn rate
**Secondary Metrics**: Email open rates, click-through rates, perk page sessions

**Supporting Research**: Resonate data shows distinct customer segments. Health-conscious (family health awareness) and budget-conscious ($25-50k income) segments could receive targeted perk communications.

---

### **C3: Integrated Customer Experience Portal**
**Timeline**: 3+ months | **Priority**: Medium | **Target**: All active customers

**Hypothesis**: Embedding perks into core policy management experience will increase utilization and create stronger retention through integrated value perception.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current separated perk experience (nav link to separate page)
- **Test**: Integrated dashboard showing policy details + available perks + usage tracking + personalized recommendations

**Primary Metric**: Overall customer retention across all tenure cohorts
**Secondary Metrics**: Portal engagement time, perk utilization rates, customer satisfaction scores

**Supporting Research**: Core-aligned presentation failed in quote form, but post-purchase integration may work differently when customers are in "policy management" mindset rather than "purchase decision" mindset.

---

### **C4: Dynamic Retention Triggers**
**Timeline**: 2 months | **Priority**: High | **Target**: High churn risk customers (3-6 month emphasis)

**Hypothesis**: Triggering perk communications based on churn risk signals will be more effective than calendar-based campaigns.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current quarterly PERKS_BLAST timing
- **Test**: Dynamic triggers (decreased engagement, missed payments, competitor research behavior, policy review activity)

**Primary Metric**: Prevented churn rate for triggered customers
**Secondary Metrics**: Campaign frequency, engagement rates, cost per retained customer

**Supporting Research**: Current performance gap (4.5% vs 11%) suggests timing misalignment. Reactive triggering based on actual behavior may recapture lost effectiveness.

## RAPID EXPERIMENTS (Safer Bets - Lower Resource, Quick Validation)

### **R1: Spot-Perks Page Friction Reduction**
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks | **Priority**: High | **Target**: All customers

**Hypothesis**: Reducing steps to access perks without eliminating the gate will increase engagement and retention.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current account number entry flow
- **Test A**: Auto-populate last 4 digits if customer is logged in
- **Test B**: "Forgot account number?" quick lookup tool
- **Test C**: Simplified form design with better UX

**Primary Metric**: Perk page conversion rate (entry to successful access)
**Secondary Metrics**: Time on page, bounce rate, perk engagement

**Supporting Research**: Small UX improvements could provide quick wins while maintaining exclusivity mechanism.

### **R2: Golden Journey Perk Integration**
**Timeline**: 2 weeks | **Priority**: High | **Target**: 3-6 month cohort

**Hypothesis**: Strategic perk insertions in existing golden journey emails will improve retention without requiring new campaign infrastructure.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current golden journey without additional perk content
- **Test**: Add perk callouts to existing emails at 90-day and 150-day marks

**Primary Metric**: 3-6 month cohort churn rate
**Secondary Metrics**: Email engagement rates, perk page traffic from email

**Supporting Research**: Golden Day 12 showed strong results (11% at 3 months). Strategic insertion at proven timing could recapture effectiveness.

### **R3: Hunt Journey Perk Optimization**
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks | **Priority**: Medium | **Target**: Quoters/leads

**Hypothesis**: Since all hunt emails already include perk banners, optimizing their presentation and messaging will improve quote-to-purchase conversion.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current perk banner design and messaging
- **Test A**: Value-focused messaging ($2500+ savings emphasis)
- **Test B**: Family-focused messaging (caring for pet family theme)
- **Test C**: Health-focused messaging (wellness partner emphasis)

**Primary Metric**: UTQ and QTP rates from hunt journey
**Secondary Metrics**: Email click-through to quote form, perk banner engagement

**Supporting Research**: Resonate data shows family-caring values and health consciousness. SMS test showed perks-first messaging failed, but supportive messaging might work.

---

### **R4: Homepage Perk Prominence Test**
**Timeline**: 1 week | **Priority**: Low | **Target**: Website visitors

**Hypothesis**: Moving perks above the fold will increase awareness and quote form conversion.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current below-fold placement
- **Test**: Above-fold perk mention with value anchor

**Primary Metric**: Quote form UTQ rate
**Secondary Metrics**: Perk page traffic, time on homepage

**Supporting Research**: 29/31 landing pages mention perks, but homepage placement could drive broader awareness.

---

### **R5: Email Timing Optimization**
**Timeline**: 2 weeks | **Priority**: Medium | **Target**: 3-6 month cohort

**Hypothesis**: Testing optimal send times within the proven 3-6 month window will improve engagement and retention.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Current PERKS_BLAST timing (quarterly)
- **Test A**: Monthly perk updates during 3-6 month window
- **Test B**: Bi-weekly perk highlights during 3-6 month window
- **Test C**: Event-triggered sends (policy milestones, seasons, holidays)

**Primary Metric**: 3-6 month cohort churn rate
**Secondary Metrics**: Email engagement rates, unsubscribe rates

**Supporting Research**: Multi-cohort test showed 8% churn reduction for 3-6 month customers. Increasing frequency during this window could amplify results.

## 11-MONTH COHORT EXPLORATORY EXPERIMENTS

### **E1: Annual Renewal Perk Campaign**
**Timeline**: 1 month | **Priority**: Medium | **Target**: 11-month customers

**Hypothesis**: Anniversary-timed perk communications will reduce churn during renewal decision period.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Standard customer communications at 11 months
- **Test**: "One Year Member Benefits" campaign highlighting exclusive perks and new partner additions

**Primary Metric**: 11-month+ retention rate
**Secondary Metrics**: Renewal rate, policy upgrade rate

**Supporting Research**: Golden Day 12 showed 2.9% reduction at 11 months. Anniversary timing may provide renewal motivation.

---

### **E2: Loyalty Program Positioning**
**Timeline**: 2 weeks | **Priority**: Low | **Target**: 11-month customers

**Hypothesis**: Framing perks as earned loyalty benefits rather than standard offerings will increase engagement for established customers.

**Setup**:
- **Control**: Standard perk communications
- **Test**: "Loyalty Member Rewards" messaging emphasizing tenure and earned status

**Primary Metric**: 11-month cohort engagement with perk content
**Secondary Metrics**: Perk page visits, retention rate

**Supporting Research**: Resonate data shows "respect from others" as key driver. Loyalty positioning could leverage this psychological trigger.
