# Master Spot Perks Experiment Portfolio 2025

**Strategic Approach**: Balanced testing across cohorts with emphasis (not over-focus) on 3-6 month window, plus quote form conversion optimization.

**Key Data Reality**: September 2024 test showed modest 3-6 month benefits (596 vs 622 cancellations = 26 fewer cancellations out of ~4,600 customers). Use as hypothesis to test, not gospel to follow.

**Strategic Principle**: Test broadly across cohorts to find bigger opportunities while optimizing proven areas.
