## Compliance vs. Value Trade-off

### Scenario A: Coupons Only (Compliance-Safe)
- ✓ Eliminates cashback compliance risks
- ✓ Maintains 3,590 merchants with 24,803 coupons
- ✓ Keeps 113 recognizable brands
- ✗ Loses 68.6% of merchant network
- ✗ Loses 137 major household brands
- ✗ **Brand recognition drops to 45.2%**

### Scenario B: Keep Current Mix (Compliance Risk)
- ✓ Full 11,427 merchant network
- ✓ All 250 recognizable brands available
- ✓ Stronger value proposition
- ✗ Cashback compliance exposure continues
- ✗ Requires ongoing regulatory monitoring

---

## Recommendation Considerations

### If Compliance Risk is HIGH:
- Accept the 31.4% merchant retention
- Focus messaging on quality over quantity
- Highlight strong tech, beauty, and athletic brand presence
- Emphasize pet supply availability (Petco, Chewy)

### If Compliance Risk is MODERATE:
- Consider hybrid approach:
  - Coupons for all merchants where available
  - Cashback for strategic categories (travel, automotive) with proper disclosures
  - Phase out higher-risk cashback gradually

### Questions for Legal/Compliance:
1. Can we offer cashback with enhanced disclosure requirements?
2. Are certain cashback categories lower risk than others?
3. What is the actual compliance exposure vs. perceived risk?
4. Can we structure cashback as "gift cards" or "statement credits" instead?
