- No shopping behavior insights to inform marketing strategy
- Competitors could easily replicate the same offering

### Alternative Use Case: **Viable as Pilot/Stopgap**

**Potential Scenario:**
1. Launch LifeMart immediately (Q4 2025) at zero cost
2. Measure engagement and employee feedback (3-6 months)
3. Use data to justify Wildfire investment
4. Negotiate Wildfire contract during LifeMart pilot
5. Migrate to Wildfire in 2026 if perks prove valuable

**Hybrid Benefits:**
- De-risks Wildfire investment
- Provides baseline engagement data
- Keeps perks promise to customers immediately
- Builds internal case for premium platform
