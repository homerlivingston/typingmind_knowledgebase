# Spot Perks Retention Recovery Strategy
## Stakeholder Presentation & Business Case

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Strategic Objective**: Recover lost retention effectiveness from 4.5% to target 11% churn reduction by optimizing Spot Perks program.

**Current State**: Performance degradation since transitioning from Golden Day 12 (11% churn reduction) to current PERKS_BLAST approach (4.5% churn reduction).

**Proposed Solution**: Dual-track experiment portfolio balancing immediate wins with transformational improvements, focused on proven 3-6 month customer sweet spot.

**Expected ROI**: Each 1% improvement in retention for 3-6 month cohort represents significant LTV recovery. Target 6-7% improvement represents millions in retained revenue.

## THE BUSINESS PROBLEM

### Performance Gap Analysis
- **Historical Peak**: Golden Day 12 achieved 11% churn reduction at 3 months
- **Current Performance**: PERKS_BLAST showing 4.5% churn reduction overall
- **Sweet Spot Identified**: 3-6 month cohort shows 8% churn reduction with targeted communications
- **Root Cause**: Lost measurement capability and timing misalignment

### Financial Impact of Retention Gap
- **Customer LTV**: Each retained customer represents significant long-term value
- **Churn Cost**: 6.5% performance gap (11% - 4.5%) across customer base
- **Opportunity**: Closing gap to 8-11% retention improvement could recover millions in customer value

### Strategic Context
- **Competitive Advantage**: Spot pioneered perks in pet insurance, but competitors have followed
- **Differentiation Challenge**: Need to optimize existing program rather than abandon successful strategy
- **Customer Expectation**: Perks now table stakes, but execution quality drives retention difference

## DUAL-TRACK APPROACH

### Track 1: Rapid Experiments (40% of Portfolio)
**Objective**: Immediate retention improvement with minimal resource investment

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks per experiment
**Investment**: Low (primarily marketing/content resources)
**Risk**: Low (reversible changes to existing systems)
**Expected Impact**: 2-4% retention improvement in 3-6 month cohort

### Track 2: Complex Experiments (60% of Portfolio)
**Objective**: Transformational improvements with significant upside potential

**Timeline**: 2-3 months per experiment
**Investment**: Medium-High (development resources required)
**Risk**: Medium (requires new infrastructure/processes)
**Expected Impact**: 5-8% retention improvement potential

## RAPID EXPERIMENTS: IMMEDIATE WINS

### **Business Case for Rapid Track**
- **Quick ROI**: Results visible within 2-4 weeks
- **Low Risk**: Minimal development investment, easily reversible
- **Learning Pipeline**: Each test informs complex experiment strategy
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Early wins build support for larger investments

### **R1: Golden Journey Integration** | 2 weeks | High Impact
**Investment**: Marketing content creation only
**Rationale**: Leverages existing email infrastructure and proven 3-6 month timing
**Expected ROI**: 6-8% churn reduction based on historical Golden Day 12 performance

### **R2: Hunt Journey Optimization** | 1 week | Medium Impact
**Investment**: Email template updates using Resonate customer insights
**Rationale**: All hunt emails already have perk banners - optimize messaging for better conversion
**Expected ROI**: 2-5% UTQ improvement leading to better qualified customers

### **R3: Spot-Perks Page UX** | 2-3 weeks | High Impact
**Investment**: Frontend UX improvements only
**Rationale**: Reduce access friction while maintaining exclusivity protection
**Expected ROI**: 15-25% improvement in perk utilization leading to retention benefits

### **R4: Email Timing Optimization** | 2 weeks | High Impact
**Investment**: Customer.io campaign configuration
**Rationale**: Increase frequency during proven 3-6 month sweet spot window
**Expected ROI**: Close performance gap from 4.5% to 7-9% churn reduction

### **R5: Homepage Prominence** | 1 week | Medium Impact
**Investment**: Frontend layout modification
**Rationale**: Increase perk awareness to drive quote form conversion
**Expected ROI**: 1-3% UTQ improvement

## COMPLEX EXPERIMENTS: TRANSFORMATIONAL IMPACT

### **Business Case for Complex Track**
- **High Impact Potential**: Address fundamental program limitations
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Create unique customer experiences competitors can't easily replicate
- **Long-term Value**: Infrastructure improvements benefit multiple use cases
- **Strategic Positioning**: Position Spot as perks program innovation leader

### **C1: Account Gate Elimination** | 2-3 months | Transformational
**Investment**: Backend authentication system, policy lookup API integration
**Business Case**: Current gate creates access barrier preventing retention benefits. Alternative authentication maintains exclusivity while reducing friction.
**Risk Mitigation**: Progressive rollout with multiple authentication methods tested
**Expected ROI**: Significant perk utilization increase leading to strong retention improvement

### **C2: Proactive Perk Delivery** | 2-3 months | High Impact
**Investment**: Resonate API integration, Customer.io personalization, behavioral tracking
**Business Case**: Current one-size-fits-all approach showing degraded performance. Personalization based on customer psychographics could restore historical effectiveness.
**Competitive Advantage**: Most competitors offer generic perk programs - personalization creates differentiation
**Expected ROI**: Recovery of historical 11% retention performance through targeted messaging

### **C3: Integrated Customer Portal** | 3+ months | Strategic
**Investment**: Significant frontend/backend development, portal redesign
**Business Case**: Separate perk experience may contribute to low utilization. Integration into core customer experience could increase engagement.
**Long-term Value**: Platform for future customer experience enhancements beyond perks
**Expected ROI**: Improved overall customer satisfaction and retention across all tenure cohorts

### **C4: Dynamic Retention Triggers** | 2 months | Innovative
**Investment**: Real-time analytics, behavioral scoring, automated campaign triggers
**Business Case**: Calendar-based campaigns missing optimal intervention moments. Behavior-triggered outreach addresses specific customer concerns.
**Competitive Advantage**: Most retention programs are reactive - proactive intervention creates significant differentiation
**Expected ROI**: Prevention of high-value customer churn through early intervention

## RISK MITIGATION & CONTINGENCY PLANNING

### **Low-Risk Approach**
- **Sequential Testing**: Each experiment builds on previous learnings
- **Control Groups**: Maintain measurement capability throughout
- **Reversible Changes**: Rapid experiments can be rolled back if needed
- **Progressive Rollout**: Complex experiments tested with subset before full deployment

### **Technical Risk Management**
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage Customer.io, Segment, existing analytics
- **Proven Technologies**: Use established tools rather than building custom solutions
- **Development Resources**: Stage complex experiments to avoid overwhelming team capacity

### **Business Risk Considerations**
- **Exclusivity Concern**: Account gate alternatives maintain perceived value while reducing friction
- **Customer Experience**: All changes designed to improve rather than disrupt existing experience
- **Competitive Response**: Focus on execution quality rather than easily copyable features
