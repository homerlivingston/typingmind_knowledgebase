## Test Results by Cohort

### **3-6 Month Cohort** (Target Sweet Spot)
- **Control**: 8.26% churn rate
- **Test Group A**: 8.71% churn rate

- **Result**: Perks **decreased** churn by 0.73% (5.4% relative improvement)

- **Result**: Perks **increased** churn by 0.45% (3.2% relative increase)
- **Interpretation**: Long-term customers may find perk communications irrelevant or annoying

## Strategic Implications

### **Incorrect Previous Assumptions**
- **Previous belief**: Performance degradation from historical highs requiring recovery
- **Reality**: Current perk strategy is actively harmful in key 3-6 month window

### **Revised Strategic Objective**
- **Old goal**: Recover from 4.5% to 11% churn reduction
- **New goal**: Fix fundamental perk approach that's currently increasing churn in target cohort

### **Cohort Strategy Revision**
- **3-6 months**: Complete rethink of perk presentation/timing required
- **9-12 months**: Opportunity exists but needs optimization
- **24+ months**: Consider removing perk communications entirely

This data fundamentally changes the experiment strategy from "recovery" to "fundamental redesign" of the perk program.
