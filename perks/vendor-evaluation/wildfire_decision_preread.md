# Spot Perks 3.0: Wildfire Partnership - Meeting Pre-Read

**Date:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Decision meeting on Wildfire partnership for Spot Perks 3.0
**Reading Time:** 5 minutes

---

## What We're Proposing

Partner with **Wildfire Systems** to launch a comprehensive shopping rewards platform that transforms Spot Perks from a basic discount marketplace into a strategic customer retention and revenue generation engine.

### Core Components
1. **Shopping Wall** - White-labeled marketplace with 50,000+ merchant offers
2. **Browser Extensions** - Chrome, Safari, Edge extensions that auto-apply coupons and deliver cashback
3. **Spot Points** - Branded reward currency (converts cashback dollars to Spot-branded points)
4. **Custom Offers** - Integrate existing Spot partner deals into the platform

---

## Why This Matters Strategically

### 1. Competitive Differentiation
- **No other pet insurer** offers this level of shopping rewards integration
- Potential to secure **exclusivity** in pet insurance category
- Creates high switching costs (customers lose accumulated rewards if they leave)

### 2. Customer Retention Impact
- Browser extension keeps **Spot top-of-mind** during everyday shopping
- Multiple engagement touchpoints beyond policy renewal
- Target: **50-100 basis points improvement** in retention rates

### 3. Revenue Generation (New)
Wildfire creates **four new revenue streams**:
- **Base commissions** from merchant network sales
- **Partner revenue share** - If we bring Fi collars to their network, we earn % on ALL Fi sales (even through other companies' portals)
- **Marketplace real estate** - Pet brands pay for premium placement in our shopping portal
- **Affiliate opportunities** - Spot insurance promoted in other companies' shopping portals

### 4. Business Intelligence
- Shopping behavior data reveals customer preferences
- Identify partnership opportunities based on actual purchase patterns
- Optimize marketing based on lifestyle insights

## How It Works (Customer Experience)

### Customer Journey
1. **Install browser extension** (one-time, 30 seconds)
2. **Shop normally** at 50,000+ online stores
3. **Auto-applied coupons** at checkout (saves time + money)
4. **Earn Spot Points** automatically on purchases
5. **Redeem rewards** via PayPal, gift cards, charity donation, or Spot account credits

### Reward Model Flexibility
- **Not pure cashback** - we control the branding ("Spot Points" vs. "cashback")
- **Mix of offers**: ~30% discount codes, ~70% cashback in current network
- **Option to add** pure coupon/discount center alongside cashback
- **Compliance friendly** - backend conversion from dollars to points

---

## Implementation Approach: Pilot First

### Recommended Path: Turnkey Solution
**Why Turnkey (6-8 weeks) vs. Custom Build (3-6 months)**
- Wildfire's team believes their existing codebase is faster to deploy than custom API build
- Fully documented, proven with Citi, RBC, Visa, Acorns
- Can migrate to custom experience later if needed

### 3-6 Month Pilot Structure
- Launch "shopping wall" with **limited rollout** to test cohort
- **50/50 A/B test**: Half get browser extension, half don't
- Measure retention impact, adoption rates, engagement, revenue
- **Low commitment** - validate before full-scale investment

### Integration of Existing Partners
- Can add current Spot partner offers to Wildfire marketplace
- Requires partners to onboard with Wildfire's system (some friction)
- Curate which offers appear in Spot's portal

## Financial Overview

### Investment
- **Annual Cost:** $90,000 - $120,000 (target negotiation: 20-30% reduction)
- **Implementation:** $20,000 (one-time)
- **Year 1 Total:** ~$110,000 - $140,000

### Revenue Potential (NEW)
- **Commission revenue:** $500K+ annual target from merchant sales
- **Partner revenue share:** Variable based on brands we bring to network
- **Marketplace sponsorships:** Variable based on brand interest
- **Positive ROI potential** within 6-12 months

### Retention Value
- **50 bps retention improvement** = significant LTV increase
- 100 bps improvement = transformational business impact
- Even modest retention gains justify investment

## Alternatives Considered & Why Wildfire Won

### Free Options (PerkSpot, LifeMart)
- ❌ No exclusivity (competitors can replicate)
- ❌ No browser extension (less engagement)
- ❌ No revenue generation
- ✅ Good for testing concept, not strategic differentiation

### Kalder (Card-Linked Startup)
- ✅ Innovative card-linked cashback (no extension needed)
- ✅ 8-minute setup, revenue share model
- ❌ Startup risk, smaller merchant network
- ❌ No browser extension for top-of-mind awareness

### Access Perks (Local Focus)
- ✅ 700K+ brick-and-mortar locations
- ❌ $300K-$600K annual cost (3-6x Wildfire)
- ❌ Local merchant focus misaligned with online pet supply shopping

**Wildfire wins:** Best balance of proven platform, merchant scale, browser extension, revenue potential, and reasonable cost.

## Questions We Anticipate

**Q: Why not build this ourselves?**
A: Wildfire estimates 3-6 months to build custom vs. 6-8 weeks turnkey. We can migrate to custom later if needed. Building from scratch requires merchant relationships (50,000+) which takes years.

**Q: What if customers don't adopt browser extensions?**
A: Shopping wall works standalone. Extension is bonus engagement layer. A/B test will validate adoption rates. Target: 25% installation rate in test group.

**Q: How do we compete with Rakuten/Honey?**
A: We don't compete—we white-label Wildfire's infrastructure. Customers see "Spot Perks," not a generic cashback site. Branding = differentiation.

**Q: What's the compliance risk with cashback?**
A: Legal review required. Spot Points framing (vs. cashback) provides flexibility. Wildfire handles payments, reducing our regulatory exposure.

**Q: Can we really get exclusivity?**
A: TBD—negotiation in progress. Critical to justify investment and prevent competitor replication.

### Next Steps (Next 30 Days)
1. **Legal:** Review cashback/Spot Points structure for compliance
2. **Negotiation:** Finalize pricing (target 20-30% reduction) and exclusivity terms
3. **Dev Team:** Confirm turnkey integration approach

---

## Bottom Line

Spot Perks 3.0 powered by Wildfire transforms perks from a cost center into a **strategic retention tool and revenue generator**. The pilot approach de-risks the investment while positioning Spot as the innovation leader in pet insurance benefits.

**The question isn't whether perks matter—it's whether we want to lead or follow.**
